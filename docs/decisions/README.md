# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for this application.

An ADR documents a significant architectural decision made during the project's development. It
records the decision, the context in which it was made, and its consequences.

An ADR is immutable; only its status can change (e.g., it can become deprecated or superseded). That
way, one can become familiar with the project history by reading its decision log in chronological
order.
